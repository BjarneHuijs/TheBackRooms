#The Backrooms<br>
The Backrooms is a game project built with a team of 5 people in context of a course for Digital Arts and Entertainment or DAE for short.<br>
The main target of the game is to survive as long as possible without dying from hunger. You can reinvigorate yourself by killing one of the <br>
victims stuck in the backrooms where you roam.<br><br>

##The concept
The idea of this game was to create an interesting twist on a well-known genre.<br>
This core idea has come in the form of the player being the monster in a horror game setting in contrast to the usual setting where the player is the victim/survivor trying to escape from a monster.
<br>
Our main philosophy was that the game had to be fun and entertaining to play, and we believe we were able to achieve that, as it feels quite satisfying when you are able to take down your victims in the game.

##Challenges
During our production process of the game we experienced some challenges. For both developers it was the first time ever using <br>
Unreal Engine 4 C++ so that brought some basic challenges with it as especially at the start we were struggling with the logic behind some of the tags and what the engine<br>
would and would not let us do.
<br>
<br>
However after those basic issues were coming to an end there were some actual programming challenges, mostly in terms of the spawning and despawning of the targets as well <br>
as the setup of their artificial intelligence.
